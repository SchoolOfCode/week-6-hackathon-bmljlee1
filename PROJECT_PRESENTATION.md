Perfect Numbers Kata

---

Overview

As I am a bit of a nerd, I decided on a maths challenge! Lets find the perfect number!
Your task is to determine if a given number is a perfect number.
A perfect number is a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

side note - divisors or to be divisible by is the list of numbers that it can divide by without leaving remainders. e.g. 8 would be 1, 2 and 4.

What You'll Learn

Users will be:

1. Practicing working with loops or functional methods to find divisors.
2. Implementing maths logic.
3. Testing their solutions against a range of inputs using unit tests.

Problem Statement

Write a function `isPerfectNumber` that takes a positive integer `n` and returns `true` if the number is a perfect number, otherwise it should be `false`.

---

Examples

- `isPerfectNumber(6)` => `true` (Divisors: 1, 2, 3. Sum = 6)
- `isPerfectNumber(28)` => `true` (Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14. Sum = 28)
- `isPerfectNumber(12)` => `false` (Divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Sum â‰  12)

---

Constraints

- Input will always be a positive integer (`n > 0`).

---

Implementation

Function Skeleton

The function is provided in `main.js`:

```js
export function isPerfectNumber(n) {
  // Your implementation here!
}
```
